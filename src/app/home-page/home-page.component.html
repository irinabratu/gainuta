            The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has had adverse impacts on bio-sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide,
            along with damage to habitat, biodiversity loss, and aridity. Tropical forest destruction accounts for about 20 percent of current
            greenhouse gas emissions, if forests are destroyed through logging or burning, their carbon is released into the atmosphere as 
            carbon dioxide, a climate-changing greenhouse gas.

            We're proud of the thousands of trees we have been responsible for planning through donations and we'll continue planting more of them.
